Recently, I watching [Yuri's stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1mRIYd7L44) about create a sphere with points in Threejs. So I decided to write a post about it, explaining how to distribute points evenly in a sphere.

## The Golden Ratio: Nature’s Secret Weapon

The golden ratio, approximately 1.618, is the irrational number `(1 + √5) / 2`. It’s famous in art and nature for creating balanced, harmonious proportions. Here, we use its irrationality to our advantage: it helps us avoid repeating patterns, ensuring points spread out uniformly across the sphere’s surface.

## Spherical coordinates overview

In 3D space, spherical coordinates offer a way to define a point using:

- `Radius`: The distance from the origin (assumed to be 1 here, as it’s a unit sphere).
- `Phi (φ)`: The polar angle, measured from the vertical axis (like colatitude, from the north pole down).
- `Theta (θ)`: The azimuthal angle, measured in the horizontal plane (like longitude on Earth).

These angles are used to compute the Cartesian coordinates `(x, y, z)` of the point on the sphere.

- `x = cos(θ) * sin(φ)`
- `y = cos(φ)`
- `z = sin(θ) * sin(φ)`

This convention aligns with a common spherical coordinate system where `phi (φ)` is the angle from the positive y-axis (0 at the north pole, π at the south pole), and `theta (θ)` is the angle in the xz-plane from the positive x-axis (0 to 2π around the equator).

## Phi (φ): Polar angle, spacing points vertically

Assumed we have total `3000` points in the sphere. We can calculate the phi angle by the following formula:

```ts
const pointsNumber = 3000;

for (let i = 0; i < pointsNumber; i++) {
  const prog = i / pointsNumber;
  const phi = Math.acos(1 - 2 * prog);
}
```

- Progress
  - `prog` starts at `0 / 3000 = 0` and ends at `2999 / 3000 ≈ 0.9997`. It’s a fraction showing how far we are through the points.
- Inside the Arccosine:
  - `1 - 2 * prog` takes that fraction and stretches it.
  - At `i = 0`: `1 - 2 * 0 = 1`.
  - At `i = 2999`: `1 - 2 * 0.9997 ≈ -0.9994`.
  - This gives us a range from 1 down to almost -1.
- Calculate phi angle:
  - `Math.acos (arccosine)` turns that range into angles.
  - `Math.acos(1) = 0` (top of the sphere).
  - `Math.acos(-0.9994) ≈ 3.1396`, close to π ≈ 3.1416 (bottom of the sphere).
  - So, `phi` goes from 0 to nearly π over 3000 steps.

## Theta (θ): Azimuthal angle, spinning around the sphere

Now, `theta` handles the angle around the sphere at each height.

```ts
const pointsNumber = 3000;
// [!code highlight:1]
const goldenRatio = (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2;

for (let i = 0; i < pointsNumber; i++) {
  const prog = i / pointsNumber;
  const phi = Math.acos(1 - 2 * prog);
  // [!code highlight:1]
  const theta = (2 * Math.PI * i) / goldenRatio;
}
```

- Golden ratio: `goldenRatio = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618`.
- Full circle: `2 * Math.PI` is one full circle in radians.
- The angular step:

  - `2 * Math.PI / goldenRatio ≈ 3.8832` radians is the step size each time `i` increases

- Wrapping Around:
  - `theta` grows with each step, wrapping around every 2π since sin and cos repeat.
  - The irrational step ensures no exact repeats, filling the circle evenly over 3000 points.

## Combining phi and theta

Now, we can calculate the Cartesian coordinates `(x, y, z)` of the point on the sphere.

```ts
const pointsNumber = 3000;
const goldenRatio = (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2;
const positions: number[][] = [];

for (let i = 0; i < pointsNumber; i++) {
  const prog = i / pointsNumber;
  const phi = Math.acos(1 - 2 * prog);
  const theta = (2 * Math.PI * i) / goldenRatio;

  // [!code highlight:4]
  const x = Math.cos(theta) * Math.sin(phi);
  const y = Math.cos(phi);
  const z = Math.sin(theta) * Math.sin(phi);
  positions.push([x, y, z]);
}
```

## Visualizing It

I used `InstancedMesh` with tiny planes (0.01x0.01) to render the points. You can see the full code below:

## Wrap Up

The golden ratio method is a neat mix of math and nature. Phi handles the vertical march, theta the circular dance, and Three.js brings it to life. And that’s how you create a sphere with points in Three.js!
