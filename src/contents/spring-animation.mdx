Spring animation is a fascinating technique rooted in physics that brings smooth, natural motion to digital interfaces. This article aims to explain how a spring animation work , the laws of physics that are behind it, and the relation between the different options you can set for a spring animation.

## The Physics of Springs

At its core, spring animation is driven by `Hooke’s Law`, which defines the force a spring exerts:

```js
F = -k * x;
```

- `F` is the force the spring uses to pull itself back.
- `k` is the spring’s stiffness—think of it as how stubborn the spring is. A big k means a stiff, tight bounce; a small k gives you a soft, wobbly vibe.
- `x` is how far the spring is stretched or compressed from its comfy, neutral position. (`x = x_target - x_current`)

The negative sign indicates that the force is always directed opposite to the displacement, pulling the spring back to its rest position.
That's mean:

- If we pull the spring ( `x > 0` ) to a certain distance away from its rest position, it will start to move back to its rest position.
- If we don't pull the spring ( `x = 0` ), the spring will stay in its rest position.

While Hooke’s Law defines the restoring force of a spring based on displacement and stiffness, force also connects to `Newton’s Second Law`:

```js
F = m * a;
```

where `m` is the mass and `a` is the acceleration of the object.

Besides, there is a damping force that resists the motion of the object. The damping force is proportional to the velocity of the object:

```js
F_damping = -d * v;
```

where `b` is the damping coefficient and `v` is the velocity of the object.

Combine these, we have the equation:

```js
F = F_spring + F_damping = m * a

-k * x - d * v = m * a
```

and we can solve it to get the acceleration:

```js
a = (-k * x - d * v) / m;
```

Ok, now we have the acceleration, we can integrate it to get the velocity and position of the object at each time step.

To calculate the velocity, we can use the following equation:

```js
v = v + a * dt;
```

where `v` is the velocity, `a` is the acceleration, and `dt` is the time step.

And finally the position:

```js
p2 = p1 + v * dt;
```

where `p2` is the new position, `p1` is the old position, `v` is the velocity, and `dt` is the time step.

The `dt` is the time step, which is the time between each frame, called **frame per second** (FPS). Usually, it's 60 frames per second, which means `dt = 1 / 60`.

## Apply to code

Now, we can use the above equations to create a spring animation in code. Here is an example of a spring animation in JavaScript:

```js
const stiffness = 300;
const damping = 20;
const mass = 1;
const frameRate = 1 / 60;

const spring = () => {
  let x = 0;
  let v = 0;
  let a = 0;

  const update = () => {
    const F_spring = -stiffness * x;
    const F_damping = -damping * v;
    const F = F_spring + F_damping;
    a = F / mass;

    v = v + a * frameRate;
    x = x + v * frameRate;

    return x;
  };

  return update;
};
```

This is the playground where you can play with the spring animation. You can adjust the stiffness, damping, and mass to see how they affect the spring animation.
